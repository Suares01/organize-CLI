<h2 id="about">About</h2>

This project aims to make your life easier when creating and interacting with your JavaScript projects. Among its main features are:

- create the directory and start the JavaScript project;
- open any project anywhere on your machine using your favorite IDE...

For now it's pretty simple, but there's more to come...

### list:user

This command is responsible for listing all the users you have created.

</p>

### set:active

Since more than one user can be created on your machine, you can define which user is the active one. The active user is the one executing the commands, so if you list or open projects, the CLI will look for the active user's projects. The same goes for creating projects. So it's important verify which user is the active, you can see this by [listing](#listuser) the users.

This command is responsible for changing the active user.

```shell
organize-cli set:active <username>
```

`-h, --help` - display help for command.
